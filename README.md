# Movie-Series-Analyzer
Python based project that plots well drafted graphs of the movie's/show's journey and a pie chart shows how many people found the movie worth it.

## How does it Work?
* The project upon given a movie title (movie/web show), scrapes the movie data from IMDb (an open database for movies and shows).
* After Scraping, it stores the data in a Python DataFrame.
* Upon performing certain operations on the data in the DataFrame, it gathers the useful insights from the data.
* The data is then showed through well drafted line and pie charts.

<strong> Technologies Used </strong>: Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript <br>
<strong> Libraries Used </strong>: Requests, BeautifulSoup (bs4), Pandas. NumPy, Matplotlib.pyplot, imdbpy, Matplotlib.GridSpec <br>
<strong> Concepts Applies </strong>: Web Scraping, Concurrency, Data Manupulation, Data Visualization.

This Website takes a few minutes to scrape the data and plot the graph. (The pre-loader page/animation is yet to be designed)

Easter Egg: This website changes the background everytime user refreshes the page.
